| 📱 [Mobile Device Usage and User Behavior](https://github.com/SorenSmith/Mobile-Device-Usage-And-User-Behavior) | This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing user behavior data across different device models and operating systems. By cleansing and transforming the dataset using SQL, we will create an interactive Tableau dashboard to uncover key insights into app usage, screen time, battery drain, and data consumption. The goal is to understand how users interact with their devices and identify trends that can inform business decisions. | [Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/soren.smith/viz/MobileDeviceUsageandUserBehavior_17417366531850/Dashboard1) |
| 🌎 [The Countries with a Lively Future](https://github.com/katiehuangx/Covid-19-and-Impact-on-Malaysia-stock-market) |In this personal project, I leveraged SQL to clean and transform a comprehensive global dataset, uncovering key socio-economic patterns across countries. Using Tableau, I developed an interactive dashboard to visualize insights on GDP, birth rates, life expectancy, and education. This project enhanced my data wrangling, visualization, and analytical storytelling skills while offering a global perspective on demographic and economic trends. | [Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/soren.smith/viz/GlobalCountriesData2023/Dashboard) |
