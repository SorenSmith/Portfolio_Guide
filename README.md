| ðŸ’¡ [Credit Card Detection Fraud](https://github.com/katiehuangx/8-Week-SQL-Challenge) | Analyzed a large credit card transaction dataset (284,807 records) to identify fraudulent activity using advanced SQL queries. Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA), detected patterns in transaction amounts and time-based behaviors, and uncovered key predictive features. Delivered actionable insights and recommendations to improve fraud detection accuracy and mitigate operational risks. | 
 | [The Job Market Crisis](https://github.com/SorenSmith/The-Job-Market-Crisis) | This project examines global layoffs (2022-2024) to identify the most affected industries, companies, and regions. The U.S. leads in layoffs, with Amazon, Meta, and Tesla among the hardest hit. Retail, tech, and consumer goods face the biggest cuts, while AI and aerospace show resilience.

| ðŸ“± [Mobile Device Usage and User Behavior](https://github.com/SorenSmith/Mobile-Device-Usage-And-User-Behavior) | This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing user behavior data across different device models and operating systems. By cleansing and transforming the dataset using SQL, we will create an interactive Tableau dashboard to uncover key insights into app usage, screen time, battery drain, and data consumption. The goal is to understand how users interact with their devices and identify trends that can inform business decisions. | [Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/soren.smith/viz/MobileDeviceUsageandUserBehavior_17417366531850/Dashboard1) |
| ðŸŒŽ [The Countries with a Lively Future](https://github.com/SorenSmith/Global-Countries-Data-2023) |In this personal project, I leveraged SQL to clean and transform a comprehensive global dataset, uncovering key socio-economic patterns across countries. Using Tableau, I developed an interactive dashboard to visualize insights on GDP, birth rates, life expectancy, and education. This project enhanced my data wrangling, visualization, and analytical storytelling skills while offering a global perspective on demographic and economic trends. | [Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/soren.smith/viz/GlobalCountriesData2023/Dashboard) |
